    "### The Problem\n",
    "When we tried to click Play on \"Independent Artists\" service, nothing happened. No music played, no errors shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Root Cause: JavaScript Module Scope\n",
    "The issue was **how files were loaded in the HTML**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<script type=\"module\" src=\"script.js\"></script>\n",
    "<script src=\"independent-music-player.js\"></script>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Difference:**\n",
    "- `script.js` → loaded as an **ES6 Module** (has its own scope)\n",
    "- `independent-music-player.js` → loaded as a **regular script** (global scope)\n",
    "\n",
    "When `script.js` tried to create `new IndependentMusicPlayer()`, it couldn't find the class because:\n",
    "- Regular scripts define things globally (`window.IndependentMusicPlayer`)\n",
    "- Modules can't automatically see globals\n",

    "## Understanding Module Scope vs Global Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: How Module Scope Works\n",
    "\n",
    "**File 1: player.js (Regular Script)**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class MusicPlayer {\n",
    "  play() { console.log('Playing...'); }\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Automatically available globally!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**File 2: app.js (ES6 Module)**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// This WON'T work in a module!\n",
    "const player = new MusicPlayer();  // ❌ Error: MusicPlayer is not defined\n",
    "\n",
    "// Even though player.js was loaded before app.js\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?**\n",
    "- Regular scripts create variables/classes in the **global scope** (accessible to everything)\n",
    "- Modules create their own **private scope** (isolated from global)\n",
    "- A module can't see globals by default\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Make It Global\n",
    "\n",
    "**In independent-music-player.js:**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// At the end of the file, after the class definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {\n",
    "  window.IndependentMusicPlayer = IndependentMusicPlayer;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now `script.js` (the module) can access it:\n",
    "```javascript\n",

    "// or just:\n",
    "const player = new IndependentMusicPlayer();  // ✅ Also works!\n",

    "\n",
    "### Root Cause: Missing Callback Page\n",

    "## Key Learnings\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Module Scope is Isolated\n",
    "- **Modules** (`type=\"module\"`) have their own scope\n",
    "- **Regular scripts** can see/modify the global scope\n",
    "- To share between them, explicitly assign to `window`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. OAuth Requires a Callback\n",
    "- OAuth is a **3-party handshake**: Your App ↔ Your Server ↔ External Service\n",
    "- The external service (Spotify) must redirect back to a URL you control\n",
    "- That URL (callback) must exist and be able to handle the auth code\n",
    "- Missing callback = broken auth flow\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Debugging Strategy\n",
    "When something doesn't work:\n",
    "1. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors\n",
    "2. **Check network tab** for failed requests\n",
    "3. **Think about the data flow** - where does data come from and go to?\n",
    "4. **Trace the code** - follow variables through the program\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. File Loading Order Matters\n",
    "In HTML:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<script src=\"dependency.js\"></script>  <!-- Loaded first -->\n",
    "<script type=\"module\" src=\"app.js\"></script>  <!-- Loaded second -->\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For modules to see regular scripts, the regular script must:\n",
    "1. Be loaded BEFORE the module\n",
    "2. Define things globally (assign to `window`)"

    "\n",
    "### What You Just Did\n",
    "\n",
    "When you ran those git commands, you performed your **first real software project release**! Here's what happened step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Three Commands Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Command 1: `git branch -M main`\n",
    "```\n",
    "Current state: Your local branch is called \"master\" (old naming convention)\n",
    "Action: Rename it to \"main\" (modern standard)\n",
    "Result: Your branch name matches GitHub's default\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:**\n",
    "- `main` is now the industry standard (GitHub changed their default in 2020)\n",
    "- Keeps your project modern and professional\n",
    "- Ensures consistency with team practices\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Command 2: `git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SmartHomeMobileInterfaceProject.git`\n",
    "```\n",
    "Local Computer              GitHub.com\n",

    "Your Project Files  ←links to→  Remote Repository\n",
    "   (On Your Mac)              (In The Cloud)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What \"origin\" means:**\n",
    "- It's a **nickname** for your GitHub repository URL\n",
    "- Think of it like a contact in your phone - instead of typing the full phone number, you just say \"Mom\"\n",
    "- Instead of typing the full GitHub URL, you just say \"origin\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Behind the scenes:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# You typed: git remote add origin https://github.com/...\n",
    "# Git now knows: origin = that long GitHub URL\n",
    "# Next time you can just say: git push origin main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Command 3: `git push -u origin main`\n",
    "```\n",
    "Step 1: Take all your committed code\n",
    "Step 2: Send it to \"origin\" (your GitHub repo)\n",
    "Step 3: Push the \"main\" branch\n",
    "Step 4: -u flag = \"set upstream\" = remember this connection\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What `-u` does:**\n",
    "- First time: `git push -u origin main` (full command needed)\n",
    "- Next time: `git push` (Git remembers!)\n",
    "- Without `-u`, you'd need to type the full command every time\n",

    "\n",
    "### If Netlify Still Says \"Not Deployed\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common reasons and solutions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reason 1: Webhook Connection Issue\n",
    "Sometimes GitHub doesn't notify Netlify immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution: Manual Redeploy**\n",
    "1. Go to https://app.netlify.com\n",
    "2. Click your site (`resplendent-shortbread-586ee5`)\n",
    "3. Find \"Deploys\" tab\n",
    "4. Look for \"Trigger Deploy\" button (top right)\n",
    "5. Click it and select \"Deploy site\"\n",
    "6. Netlify will rebuild from your latest GitHub code\n",
    "7. Watch the deploy log\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reason 2: Still Processing\n",
    "Netlify can take 2-5 minutes depending on server load.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to check:**\n",
    "- Go to your site's Deploys tab\n",
    "- Look for a deploy with **yellow/processing icon** (might say \"Building...\")\n",
    "- ⏳ Wait 5 minutes total before worrying\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reason 3: Build Configuration Issues\n",
    "If you see a failed deploy with errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to check:**\n",
    "1. Click the failed deploy\n",
    "2. Scroll down to see \"Build log\"\n",
    "3. Look for error messages in red\n",
    "4. Common errors:\n",
    "   - Missing `netlify.toml`\n",
    "   - Wrong build command\n",
    "   - Missing dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our setup should NOT have these issues because:**\n",

    "- ✅ Build command is correct (`npm run build`)\n",
    "- ✅ Dependencies are in package.json\n",
    "- ✅ Local build works (just tested it!)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reason 4: Site Not Connected Properly\n",
    "If no deploys show at all:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reconnect Netlify to GitHub:**\n",
    "1. Go to https://app.netlify.com\n",
    "2. Site Settings → Build & Deploy → Repository\n",
    "3. Verify it shows \"ElleDevz/SmartHomeMobileInterfaceProject\"\n",

    "### What We Set Up\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)\n",
    "- Automatically runs when you push to `main` branch\n",
    "- Installs dependencies\n",
    "- Runs `npm run build`\n",
    "- Deploys the `dist/` folder to GitHub Pages\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Vite Configuration Update** (`vite.config.js`)\n",
    "- Added `base: '/SmartHomeMobileInterfaceProject/'`\n",
    "- Tells Vite your app is hosted at a subdirectory (not root)\n",
    "- Ensures all assets load correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Live URL\n",
    "\n",
    "Once deployment completes (watch for green checkmark on GitHub):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "https://ElleDevz.github.io/SmartHomeMobileInterfaceProject\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Watch the Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to: https://github.com/ElleDevz/SmartHomeMobileInterfaceProject\n",
    "2. Click **\"Actions\"** tab (top navigation)\n",
    "3. You should see a workflow running: \"Setup: Add GitHub Pages deployment workflow\"\n",
    "4. Click on it to see real-time build logs\n",
    "5. Once it shows a ✅ green checkmark, your app is LIVE!\n",
    "6. This usually takes 1-2 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Build Log Output\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see:\n",
    "```\n",
    "✓ Running setup-node...\n",
    "✓ Installed dependencies\n",
    "✓ Running npm run build...\n",
    "✓ vite v7.3.0 building...\n",
    "✓ 7 modules transformed\n",
    "✓ dist/index.html: 6.12 kB\n",
    "✓ dist/assets/index.css: 9.97 kB\n",
    "✓ dist/assets/index.js: 20.78 kB\n",
    "✓ Deployment successful!\n",
