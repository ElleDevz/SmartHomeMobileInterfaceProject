    "## Issue #1: Independent Music Player Disappeared\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "When we tried to click Play on \"Independent Artists\" service, nothing happened. No music played, no errors shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Root Cause: JavaScript Module Scope\n",
    "The issue was **how files were loaded in the HTML**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<script type=\"module\" src=\"script.js\"></script>\n",
    "<script src=\"independent-music-player.js\"></script>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Difference:**\n",
    "- `script.js` → loaded as an **ES6 Module** (has its own scope)\n",
    "- `independent-music-player.js` → loaded as a **regular script** (global scope)\n",
    "\n",
    "When `script.js` tried to create `new IndependentMusicPlayer()`, it couldn't find the class because:\n",
    "- Regular scripts define things globally (`window.IndependentMusicPlayer`)\n",
    "- Modules can't automatically see globals\n",
    "- The class existed, but the module couldn't access it!"

    "## Understanding Module Scope vs Global Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: How Module Scope Works\n",
    "\n",
    "**File 1: player.js (Regular Script)**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "class MusicPlayer {\n",
    "  play() { console.log('Playing...'); }\n",
    "}\n",
    "// Automatically available globally!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**File 2: app.js (ES6 Module)**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// This WON'T work in a module!\n",
    "const player = new MusicPlayer();  // ❌ Error: MusicPlayer is not defined\n",
    "\n",
    "// Even though player.js was loaded before app.js\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?**\n",
    "- Regular scripts create variables/classes in the **global scope** (accessible to everything)\n",
    "- Modules create their own **private scope** (isolated from global)\n",
    "- A module can't see globals by default\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: Make It Global\n",
    "\n",
    "**In independent-music-player.js:**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// At the end of the file, after the class definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {\n",
    "  window.IndependentMusicPlayer = IndependentMusicPlayer;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now `script.js` (the module) can access it:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const player = new window.IndependentMusicPlayer();  // ✅ Works!\n",
    "// or just:\n",
    "const player = new IndependentMusicPlayer();  // ✅ Also works!\n",

    "## Issue #2: Spotify OAuth Not Redirecting\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "When we selected \"Spotify\" and clicked Play, the app tried to log in but didn't redirect to Spotify's login page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Root Cause: Missing Callback Page\n",
    "Spotify OAuth flow works like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **App sends user to Spotify's login page**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=...&redirect_uri=http://localhost:5173/callback\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **User logs in on Spotify's website**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Spotify redirects back to your app's callback URL**\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   http://localhost:5173/callback?code=AUTH_CODE&state=STATE\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Callback page processes the auth code and exchanges it for an access token**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Problem:** We didn't have `callback.html`! So when Spotify tried to redirect back, there was no page to handle it."

    "## Key Learnings\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Module Scope is Isolated\n",
    "- **Modules** (`type=\"module\"`) have their own scope\n",
    "- **Regular scripts** can see/modify the global scope\n",
    "- To share between them, explicitly assign to `window`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. OAuth Requires a Callback\n",
    "- OAuth is a **3-party handshake**: Your App ↔ Your Server ↔ External Service\n",
    "- The external service (Spotify) must redirect back to a URL you control\n",
    "- That URL (callback) must exist and be able to handle the auth code\n",
    "- Missing callback = broken auth flow\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Debugging Strategy\n",
    "When something doesn't work:\n",
    "1. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors\n",
    "2. **Check network tab** for failed requests\n",
    "3. **Think about the data flow** - where does data come from and go to?\n",
    "4. **Trace the code** - follow variables through the program\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. File Loading Order Matters\n",
    "In HTML:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<script src=\"dependency.js\"></script>  <!-- Loaded first -->\n",
    "<script type=\"module\" src=\"app.js\"></script>  <!-- Loaded second -->\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For modules to see regular scripts, the regular script must:\n",
    "1. Be loaded BEFORE the module\n",
    "2. Define things globally (assign to `window`)"
