    "### Solution 1: Switch to Official GitHub Actions ✅ (RECOMMENDED)\n",

    "**Use this workflow** (what finally worked):\n",

    "  id-token: write\n",

    "          node-version: '20'\n",
    "      - run: npm install\n",

    "\n",
    "If you prefer the third-party action, you need to:\n",

    "## Key Learnings from the Troubleshooting Process\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Official > Third-Party for Critical Tasks\n",
    "**Lesson:** For core platform features like GitHub Pages deployment, use official GitHub actions\n",
    "- Official: `actions/upload-pages-artifact` + `actions/deploy-pages`\n",
    "- Third-party: `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages` (still good, but requires more config)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Permissions Block Only Works with Official Actions\n",
    "**Lesson:** The `permissions` block in workflows only affects official GitHub actions\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "permissions:\n",
    "  pages: write  # ← Only respected by official GitHub actions\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Token Scoping is Automatic with Environment Block\n",
    "**Lesson:** Using `environment: name: github-pages` automatically scopes the token correctly\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "environment:\n",
    "  name: github-pages  # ← This is the magic - auto-scopes token\n",
    "  url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Artifact-Based Deployment is More Secure\n",
    "**Lesson:** Separating build and deploy with artifacts is better because:\n",
    "- Build job can't accidentally push to main\n",
    "- Deploy job has limited filesystem access\n",
    "- Each job can have different permissions\n",
    "- Cleaner separation of concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Troubleshooting Order\n",
    "**When GitHub Actions fails:**\n",
    "1. Check if using official action (if not, consider switching)\n",
    "2. Check the `permissions` block (must match what action needs)\n",
    "3. Check the `environment` block (needed for GitHub Pages)\n",
    "4. Read the actual error message carefully\n",
    "5. Check GitHub's documentation for the specific action\n",
    "6. Consider if the problem is the action itself, not the config\n",

    "fatal: Permission to ElleDevz/SmartHomeMobileInterfaceProject.git denied to github-actions[bot]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Root Cause:**\n",
    "GitHub Actions workflow didn't declare `pages: write` permission\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "Add `permissions` block to workflow:\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "permissions:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Issue: \"Could not resolve './independent-music-player.js'\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**When:** During `npm run build`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Module path is incorrect or file doesn't exist\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix:**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// ❌ Wrong\n",
    "import IndependentMusicPlayer from './independent-music-player.js';\n",
    "\n",
    "// ✅ Correct\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue: Audio Doesn't Play (CORS Error)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Symptom:** Console error: \"NetworkError\" or \"The media resource indicated by the src attribute or assigned media provider object was not suitable\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix:**\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "this.audioElement = new Audio();\n",
    "this.audioElement.crossOrigin = 'anonymous';  // ← Add this line\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue: vite.config.js Not Found\n",
    "\n",
    "**When:** Error during `npm run build`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix:**\n",
    "Create `vite.config.js` at project root with:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "import { defineConfig } from 'vite';\n",
    "\n",
    "export default defineConfig({\n",

    "### Issue: Spotify Code Import Fails\n",
    "\n",
    "**When:** Build fails with \"Could not resolve './spotify-config.js'\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Options:**\n",
    "1. **Option A (Simple):** Create stub file\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   // spotify-config.js\n",
    "   const SPOTIFY_CONFIG = {\n",

    "## Lessons Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. GitHub Pages Requires Explicit Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lesson:** Always add `permissions` block to GitHub Actions workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** GitHub Actions uses least-privilege tokens by default. You must explicitly declare what access is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "# DO THIS ALWAYS for GitHub Pages\n",
    "permissions:\n",
    "  contents: read\n",
    "  pages: write      # ← Required for peaceiris/actions-gh-pages\n",
    "  id-token: write   # ← Required for OIDC token\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. GitHub Pages Subdirectory Needs Base Path\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lesson:** Project sites (not user/org) need `base:` in Vite config\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Your repo is at `https://github.com/ElleDevz/SmartHomeMobileInterfaceProject`, so your site is at `https://ElleDevz.github.io/SmartHomeMobileInterfaceProject/`. Assets must be referenced with this base path.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Future Deployments:** Always add this to `vite.config.js`:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "base: '/YourRepoName/',\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. ES6 Modules Require Proper Async Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lesson:** When using `type=\"module\"`, scripts load in parallel (async)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Code might run before dependencies are loaded\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Use proper imports/exports and wait for DOM to load:\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {\n",
    "    // Code here runs after DOM is ready AND modules are loaded\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. CORS Headers for Audio/Video\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lesson:** Cross-origin resources need `crossOrigin = 'anonymous'`\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "this.audioElement.crossOrigin = 'anonymous';  // ← Always add for external audio\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Node.js Version Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lesson:** Vite 7.3.0 requires Node 20.19 or higher\n",
    "\n",
    "**Always check:** `npm create vite@latest` output or your Vite docs\n",
    "\n",
    "**In GitHub Actions:** Explicitly set `node-version: '20'` or higher\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Build Locally First\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practice:** Always run `npm run build` locally before pushing\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "npm run build    # Catches errors before GitHub Actions\n",
    "npm run preview  # Test the production build locally\n",
    "git push         # Only push if both commands succeed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Simplify When Stuck\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lesson:** If a feature is causing build failures, consider removing it\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Spotify integration kept failing due to missing config file. Removing it:\n",
    "- ✅ Eliminated build errors\n",
    "- ✅ Reduced bundle size\n",
    "- ✅ Simplified code\n",
    "- ✅ Got app live faster\n",

    "   - Lights toggle/dimmer → should work\n",
    "   - Temperature +/- → should work\n",
    "3. **Celebration:** App is now live! 🎉\n",
    "\n",
    "### If Build Still Fails ❌\n",
    "1. Click on the failing workflow\n",
    "2. Expand the \"Deploy to GitHub Pages\" step\n",
    "3. Look at the error message in red\n",
    "4. Common issues:\n",
    "   - \"Permission still denied\" → Need `write: all` in permissions\n",
    "   - \"Build failed\" → Check `npm run build` output locally\n",
